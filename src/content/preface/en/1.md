**Sailor** knows no map but the heart's true north, and though my vessel is built for the chaos of the open sea, I find my only lasting anchor in the gentle truth of your gaze; for my soul is the ship's deepest draft, but your love is the tide that lifts me from every shallow, making every distant horizon less of a quest for land, and more of a promise to return to the unwavering light you keep burning.
